# Project Vision
This product will be produced for usage in any size restaurant ranging from small to large, who want to upgrade or move their system to a simple online format. This system can be used for both customers, for booking and registering purposes, and staff for editing details about the restaurant. The name of this product is simply Single Page Application for a Restaurant Management System, or SPARMS for short. Due to the global pandemic of COVID-19, owners of restaurants are trying to move their bookings online in order to protect themselves and other customers. This product allows the restaurant to ensure everyone’s safety is maintained to a high standard. It also allows the restaurant owner to edit the table size and amount of customers allowed in per the governments rules and regulations.
